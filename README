This is a learning project for making a chess server and web client using
node.js. This is my first node.js project. The goal is to be able to play
chess across the internet. Some stretch goals would be to make a login
system, use a replicated database for reliable storage, log usage metrics
and things like error rates for alerting, etc. The first draft will use
in-memory storage of games and will not have much authentication, as learning
the basics of a new framework (node.js) is the primary goal.
